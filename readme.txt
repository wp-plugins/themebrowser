Show off the themes available for blogs in your WPMU site or Wordpress MultiSite with a simple shortcode in any post or page.

== Description ==

If you run a WPMU (called Wordpress MultiSite in version 3 or above) webite where people can create their own blogs and choose a theme, it would be great to show off the available themes before people sign up. That's always a been a bit hard to do, until now. This very simple plugin allows you to add a shortcode - [themebrowser] - to any post or page where you want the full list of enabled themes to show.

You can also paginate the themes by adding a "perpage" attribute to the shortcode, like this: [themebrowser perpage="10"]

The list does not include themes that you have disabled in Site Admin. The details shown are the theme name, description and a screenshot (themes without a screenshot are also not included).

== Installation ==

Install the plugin from the Wordpress plugin repository and activate. Then add the [themebrowser] shortcode to any post or page for the list of themes to be shown.
